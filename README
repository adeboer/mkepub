NAME
    mkepub - simple tool to convert XHTML to EPUB

SYNOPSIS
    mkepub [ -a author | -f firstname -l lastname ] -t title [ -i
    cover-.jpeg ] basename

DESCRIPTION
    mkepub converts an XHTML document or document tree into an EPUB file.

    For a given basename *foo* it looks for either a directory named *foo*
    which must contain all the documents (including illustrations and
    styling: GIF, JPEG, PNG, SVG, and CSS are supported), or a file named
    *foo.html* if only a single unadorned file is to be converted. There
    must be a cover image which should normally be called *foo.jpeg*. It
    will produce *foo.epub* as output.

    The file list of a *foo* directory will be sorted lexically and
    recursively, with *index.html* files being sorted to the start of their
    directory, so the one in the base directory will be the first page of
    the book.

OPTIONS
    -a author
        Specify an author, typically when it is an entity or role account.
        Use either this OR the *-f*/*-l* pair.

    -f firstname
        The first name of the author. Use with *-l* to get *firstname
        lastname* and *lastname, firstname* in appropriate contexts.

    -i coverimage
        Specify a JPEG cover image of other than the default filename.

    -l lastname
        The last name of the author.

    -t title
        Specify the title text for the ebook (usually in quotes!).
