[1mNAME[0m
       mkepub - simple tool to convert XHTML to EPUB

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       mkepub [ -a author | -f firstname -l lastname ] -t title [ -i
       cover-.jpeg ] basename

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mmkepub [22mconverts an XHTML document or document tree into an EPUB file.

       For a given basename [4mfoo[24m it looks for either a directory named [4mfoo[0m
       which must contain all the documents (including illustrations and
       styling: GIF, JPEG, PNG, SVG, and CSS are supported), or a file named
       [4mfoo.html[24m if only a single unadorned file is to be converted.  There
       must be a cover image which should normally be called [4mfoo.jpeg[24m.  It
       will produce [4mfoo.epub[24m as output.

       The file list of a [4mfoo[24m directory will be sorted lexically and
       recursively, with [4mindex.html[24m files being sorted to the start of their
       directory, so the one in the base directory will be the first page of
       the book.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       -a author
           Specify an author, typically when it is an entity or role account.
           Use either this OR the [4m-f[24m/[4m-l[24m pair.

       -f firstname
           The first name of the author.  Use with [4m-l[24m to get [4mfirstname[0m
           [4mlastname[24m and [4mlastname,[24m [4mfirstname[24m in appropriate contexts.

       -i coverimage
           Specify a JPEG cover image of other than the default filename.

       -l lastname
           The last name of the author.

       -t title
           Specify the title text for the ebook (usually in quotes!).
